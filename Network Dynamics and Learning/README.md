## Network Dynamics and Learning - DSE @ PoliTO ay 2022-2023

These are the Homeworks I carried with [@nicolovergaro](https://github.com/nicolovergaro) for the Network Dynamics and Learning exam. There are three homeworks for which you can find both the python code I used to solve the problems and a report in which I explain my reasoning and report the main results.

### Homework I
In the first [homework](https://github.com/pietrocagnasso/Polito-MSc/blob/main/Network%20Dynamics%20and%20Learning/Homework%20I/Report.pdf) we worked on three exercises on flows, max flow-min cut theorem, matchings, equilibria, system optimum traffic assignment, price of anarchy and tolls.

### Homework II
In the second [homework](https://github.com/pietrocagnasso/Polito-MSc/blob/main/Network%20Dynamics%20and%20Learning/Homework%20II/Report.pdf) we workd on three exercises about random walks on a graph, hitting and return times and French-DeGroot dynamic. We have also studied the position of particles in a system with proportional and fixed input rates both from particles and nodes perspectives.

### Homework III
In the last [homework](https://github.com/pietrocagnasso/Polito-MSc/blob/main/Network%20Dynamics%20and%20Learning/Homework%20III/Report.pdf) we worked on the symulation of a pandemic inspired by the Influenza H1N1 in Sweeden, 2009 testing as underlying graph models the preferential attachment random graph and the small-world random graph. In the second exercise we worked on the coloring problem using a Noisy Best Response dynamic.
