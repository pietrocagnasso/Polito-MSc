# Sentiment Classification of Tweets
## Data Science Lab - DSE @ PoliTO ay 2021-2022
This is the project I carried out for the exam in January 2022. It was a challenge between students based on the f1 score we could reach in a sentiment classification of tweets.

[Here](https://github.com/pietrocagnasso/Polito-MSc/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Lab:%20Processes%20and%20Methods/Report.pdf) you can find the report I wrote.

N.B. Data are zipped since a file exceeded the limits of GitHub.
