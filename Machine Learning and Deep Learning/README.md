# Understanding the Main Challenges of Federated Learning
## Machine Learning and Deep Learning - DSE @ PoliTO ay 2021-2022
This project was done in collaboration with [@nicolovergaro](https://github.com/nicolovergaro) and [@GiuseppeGalilei](https://github.com/GiuseppeGalilei). Here you can find the final [report]() and exam presentation [sildes]()

Goals:
* implement a **centralized baseline** to define an upper bound
* implement a **federated baseline** (FedAvg)
* explore **system heterogeneity** (FedGKT)
* simulate a **gradient inversion attack**
* explore **statistical heterogeneity** (FedDyn)
